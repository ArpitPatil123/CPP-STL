# STL Examples Repository

This repository contains examples and usage demonstrations of various Standard Template Library (STL) containers and algorithms in C++. It is organized into different folders, each representing a container or algorithms.

## Table of Contents

- [Array](./Containers/Array.cpp)
- [Vector](./Containers/Vector.cpp)
- [Deque](./Containers/deque.cpp)
- [List](./Containers/List.cpp)
- [Set](./Containers/Set.cpp)
- [Map](./Containers/Map.cpp)
- [Stack](./Containers/Stack.cpp)
- [Queue](./Containers/Queue.cpp)
- [Priority Queue](./Containers/PriorityQueue.cpp)
- [Algorithms](./Algorithms/Algorithms.cpp)

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide clear and concise examples of using different containers and algorithms available in the C++ Standard Template Library. Each folder contains dedicated examples and explanations for the specific container or algorithm, along with code snippets and usage guidelines.

By exploring this repository, you will learn how to effectively utilize the various STL containers and algorithms in your C++ projects. It serves as a valuable resource for beginners who want to grasp the fundamentals of the STL and experienced developers looking for reference implementations.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply navigate to the relevant folder of the container or algorithm you are interested in. Each folder contains a `README.md` file with detailed explanations, code samples, and usage instructions.

Feel free to explore the examples, modify the code, and experiment with different scenarios to deepen your understanding of the STL. You can also use these examples as a starting point for your own projects, adapting and expanding upon them to suit your specific needs.
